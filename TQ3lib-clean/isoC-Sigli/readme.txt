This is an example using OC and the OC application software interface

Provided by Christophe Sigli October 2015

The example calculates liquidus/solidus/transformation temperatures
using a database for aluminium.  For that purpose the COST507 database
is provided.

NOTE THAT THE COST507 database is not validated for multicomponent
alloys.  The results must not be taken as accurate.

The main program Example_TQ requires an input file, here the input.txt
is provied.  If you want to change alloy or what the program should
calculate you must change this input file.

The calculated results are tabulated on the screen.
