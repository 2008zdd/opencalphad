OC software.}

{\large \bf Please be aware that this software is a beta test version.
Your feedback about problems and errors is important to make it
better.}

OC cannot replace your favourite thermodynamic software today or
tomorrow but the main advantage is that you have access to the source
code and can (with some efforts) add or fix things yourself that you
are missing in your favourite software.

\section{Getting started}

\begin{itemize}
\item The code is written in the new Fortran standard and requires 
a compiler like GNU Fortran 4.4 or similar.

\item The development is made on Windows with MinGW installed and
there is a file ``linkmake.txt'' which you should rename to
``linkmake.cmd'' in order to compile and link an executable program
from the source code.  If you are using UNIX you can modify this file
or write a Makefile.

\item There is a website, http:://www.opencalphad.com, for
information, questions and discussions on the software and databases.

\item The documentation of the source code is in the directory
``documentationupdate''.  A very rudimentary user guide (also
available on line in the file ``ochelp.hlp'') is the
``manual''directory).  The ``macro'' directory has examples for a
variety of calculations.  In some test releases these are not included
but they can be downloaded from the web site.

\item For the graphics you must download and install the GNUPLOT
  software.  That is freely available from the web.

\item Contributions of new and improved source code are welcome.
Contact Bo Sundman if you want to know how.

\item The command line interface has a ``VAX/VMS'' flavour which
reflects the age of the developer.  It means the commands are
``verbs'' like {\em set, list, calculate, enter etc.}.  After the verb
several objects are usually possible.  There is some redundancy so the
same effect can be achieved by different combinations of verbs and
objects.  Each command and subcommand can be abbreviated.

If you are burning to develop another user interface you are welcome
to do so.

\item Thermodynamic data can be read from a (unencrypted) TDB file
{\em read tdb ``filename''} or entered interactively.  You can specify
which elements you want from the TDB file but not exclude any phases.

\item There are some exception from how data are entered into OC
comparared to Thermo-Calc, most important perhaps the ``partitioning''
of a phase into an ordered and disordered part.  OC has implemeneted
this in a different way and at present it is not possible for OC to
read such partitioned data from a TDB file.

\item You can save the thermodynamic data and results from a
calculation on an unformatted file {\em save un ``filename''}
and this can be read back into the program {\em read un ``filename''}.

If you already have data in the program you have to confirm that you
want to overwrite them.  You can also remove the data by the command
{\em new YES}.

You can list data on the screen but there is no way to write a TDB
file from OC yet.  The OC format for TDB files will be slightly
different from that used by Thermo-Calc.

\item You can also have data entered from a macro file as well as
commands for calculations.  In order to document errors or problems
please send a complete macro file reproducing the error.  You can
generate a macro file interactivly by setting a log file {\em set log
``filename''} and then (after some editing) use the log file as a
macro.

\item Setting conditions is very similar to the Thermo-Calc software.
Each condition is set separately by the command is {\em set cond
``state variable'' = ``value''}.  The safest conditions for
calculating an equilibrium, i.e. which has most chance to converge, is
to set values on T, P and N(element), i.e. the total amount of each
element.  The table at the end gives a list of state variable symbols
and their meaning.

It is also possible to set conditions on chemical potentials and that
a phase is stable (fix).  See the macro file examples how this is
done.  Note that many commands are fragile and they may also change
between releases of the test versions of the OC software, depending on
suggestions by users.

The intention is that you should be able to combine any set of
conditions to calculate the equilibrium, i.e. you can combine
conditions on mole fractions, mass fractions, fix phases, chemical
potentials etc.  In the next release the plan is to allow expressions
of conditions, not just a single state variable.

\item The command {\em calculate equilibrium (c e)} tries to calculate
the equilibrium.  As the minimizer needs a guess of stable phases and
their start constitution, the OC software tries first to invoke a
global grid minimizer.  If you want to provide a guess of the set of
stable phases you can use the {\em set phase ``name'' const} followed
by the command {\em calculate no\_global (c n)}.

\item The grid minimizer that calculates start points for the general
minimizer is very primitive.  If you have ideas how to improve it you
are welcome to provide advice or code.

\item The convergence has improved a lot compared to the first release
but you will still frequently have problems with convergence, many
times there will be error messages and sometimes the software may
converge to the wrong equilibrium.  In this test version you should
always check the results with you favourite thermodynamic software.

If the calculation does not converge try to use the command {\em ``c
n''} two or three times to continue to iterate from the set of phases
you have.  The {\em ``c e''} command runs the grid minimiser and,
therefore, will give the same result each time.

You can also try to increase the number of iterations {\em set num 500
,,,,}.  Or you can manually set the phases you think are stable {\em
set phase const} followed by {\em ``c n''}.  You can suspend
metastable phases that you think cause problems {\em set status phase
``name'' sus}.

You can try to simplify the conditions for a first calculation and
then change them to those you are interested in and for each change
calculate using {\em ``c n''}.  Calculations at temperatures and
compositions where the system is single phase have a higher chance of
success.  The algorithm to change the set of stable phases is fragile
and has not been fine tuned.

\item There is a simple step procedure to calculate property diagrams.
It uses gnuplot to handle the graphics.  If you are interested in this
feature there will be a discussion group on the future design of the
step and map (of phase diagrams) commands and graphical output.

\item To report errors and problems please attach a macro file that
reproduces the problem.  To create a macro file run the command
interface with a log file and edit the log file to be a macro.  Both
the macro file and the model parameters (preferably in a tdb file)
must be submitted.  Try to find the simplest case that reproduces the
error.

\end{itemize}

\section{A summary of state variables.}

The state variables in the user interface have their common symbols,
$T$ for temperature, $P$ for pressure, $N$ for the total amount of
moles, ``$N$(element)'' for the amount of moles of a component,
``$X$(element)'' for the mole fraction ``$MU$(element)'' for the
chemical potential, ``$AC$(element)'' for the activity.  The symbol
$B$ is used for the total mass (copied from the Thermo-Calc software),
``$B$(element)'' for the mass of an element and ``$W$(element)'' for
the mass fraction.  There are many more state variables like $H$, $G$
etc, see the table, but not all of them can be used as conditions.

internal representation.  Some model parameter properties are also

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

You can specify that a phases should be stable by the command {\em set
status phase}.  For example to calculate the melting point of an alloy
after specifying the composition and making a calculation at fixed T
and P, you can give the commands {\em set cond T=none; set status
liquid=fix 0; c n}.  (The commands must be given on separate lines).

In some cases it is convenient to use the command {\em set input
amount} to specify the amounts of a redundant set of species that are
added together to make up the overall composition.

\section{Manipulating the source code}

The OC software is provided with a GNU license which means that you
have the source code and can use it and modify it as you wish as long
as you do not try to make money of it.  If you want to include the OC
software in a commercial program you must contact the copyright
owners.

There is a fairly extensive documentation of the source code in the
directory ``documentationupdate'' and if you look at the code itself
there are some comments there too.  I have spent a lot of effort to
make the datastructures general and flexible to handle multicomponent
and multiphase systems.  But there was quite a lot of redundancy
introduced during the development that eventually will be removed.
The set of subroutines is less structured and one problem has been
that this code was my first attempt to use the new Fortran standard so
there are probably many things that can be made simpler.  You are
welcome to point out where this can be done.  The hope is to have a
new release before the end of 2013 with an improved version of this
part of the code and some more thermodynamic models and facilities for
conditions and generating diagrams will be available.

As I have understood the data structures (TYPE) in the new Fortran
standard is more or less identical to those used in C++ so it should
not be too difficult to combine code written in these languages.

\section{Application software library}

There are some routines provided that makes it possible to integrate
the OC software in application programs.  Those can be found in the
directory ``TQlib'' together with a sample test program.  To compile
and run this the OClib.a file and some of the ``mod'' files must be
copied to this directory.

The test program has also been converted to C although without any
user interctivity, anyone knowledgable about C is welcome to improve
this.

Use only subroutines in this library to access the OC software, do not
call directly subroutines inside the OC code as they may not be
available or have different functionallity in a future release.  If
you miss some routines please contact the OC software group.

\section{Examples}

To help you get started calculating a number of examples is
provided in the ``macro'' directory.
